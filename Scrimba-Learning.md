### A short blog by Ryan Moore :heart_eyes:

I've started learning Javascript on Scrimba, and have found it very helpful in explaining the different elements that are needed to build an undersatnding of how to build websites using Javascript. What has been fun is realizing that there are lots of similarities between the different coding langauges I already have a bit of familiarity with, which is C++ and C#. A lot of the concepts are the same, which is super nice in the long run. At first I thought they were 100% the same, but now I am learning they are ~~not~~ just close. There are still some differences.

**These are some of the things I think Scrimba does very well:**
1. They teach you and then have you practice immediately. 
    - *It's not just a video, it's interactive.*
2. They have small challenges that you can then build off of. 
    - *When you learn something, you then have a chance to put it to work immediately.* 
    - *You don't have a chance to forget the info before you use it.*
3. The teachers are really good at explaining each concept in detail. 
    - *Some teachers are better than others, but all of them are decent at least.* 
4. They make learning fun!

**Currently one of my favorite types of code is below:**

```
document.getElementById('textbox_id').value *to get the value of desired box*

**For example,** document.getElementById("searchTxt").value;
```
