# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 20, 2021
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started with the Basic HTML lessons to get a starting point for code. Finished the first 

**Thoughts:** Just started this whole process and am using FreeCodeCamp's early lessons to get a footing of what I should be doing. I'm pretty new, and don't really understand a whole lot of what is going on. Will try and keep this up every single day, even I feel completely confused and lost. Yay to trying something new!

**Link to work:** Don't have any real work yet... starting with exercises on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)


### Day 1: February 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started learning the basics of CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the lesson and added some of the code to my Week-1-HTML file.

**Thoughts**: I've always wondered how CSS works and am blown away by how simple it is on a basic level. I'm guessing I haven't gotten far enough into it to really start learning the nuances, but it's exciting to learn things like margins and padding. Then also understanding the hierarchy of classes, IDs, and types. Just barely scratching the surface really. Stoked to see where this goes.

### Day 2: February 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More progress on CSS and how to combine colors as well as using opacity to create new shapes. Just touched on animation as well. So cool!! Finished up the Applied Visual Design section on FCC.

**Thoughts**: CSS is continuing to impress me with how powerful it is, as well as how many uses there are for it. I used to think it just helped make text look a certain way, but now understand that it can be used for so many other things. From creating shapes to animation to create full scenes almost all online. Very cool! Lots more to still go, but very impressed all the way around.

### Day 3: February 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working through the rules of HTML Accessibility and making sure the design of different elements can be read by Screen Readers & the colorblind. Didnâ€™t realize how important this was! Gotta fill out those Alt tags every time!!

**Thoughts**: While I've worked on developing websites for different events and ideas before, I never really took the time to notice how important it is to make sure the code is properly formatted for other reading devices. I've always just used WYSIWYG elements and when it looked write I called it done. Now I'm realizing there is so much more to all of the devices that crawl the web. I really need to focus more on filling out all of the elements so it's as readable as possible for a wide range of uses.

### Day 4: February 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished two FCC lessons! Learned how to use CSS format text to be responsive to screen size & width, then using flexbox to align elements in rows & columns corresponding to each other. Love how easily it builds balance! I can see this as being super powerful moving forward!

**Thoughts**: I've known that you can create small sections of content using the <div> fuction, but didn't realize you could then take those elements and super easily build rows or columns out of them! Super useful! I can see this being used a lot for building out formatting within apps and making sure certain types of text or buttons will end up being able to adjust to different screen sizes and DPI's. Need to dive into all of it more, and looking forward to tackling some of the projects coming up. Kinda nervous, but stoked to be learning all of this!

### Day 5: February 25, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grids!!! Learned how to build proper grid columns and rows, set up grid templates, and make grids in grids. This whole concept has been a bit harder to wrap my head around (probably should use minmax ;) ) but making progress. Slow but steady! Started on the projects at the end of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

**Thoughts**: Grids kick it all up a notch. Now there's a way to build out elements that will be responsice not only to screen size, but to each other in really controlled ways. I'm still fairly unclear on the way that the grid is counted vertically and horizontally, but at least understand how it can be build using the grid-template-areas property. Lots to still learn. Crashed my longboard today so typing is hard. Such is life... :S

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
