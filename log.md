**Today's Progress**: Started with the Basic HTML lessons to get a starting point for code. Finished the first 

**Thoughts:** Just started this whole process and am using FreeCodeCamp's early lessons to get a footing of what I should be doing. I'm pretty new, and don't really understand a whole lot of what is going on. Will try and keep this up every single day, even I feel completely confused and lost. Yay to trying something new!

**Link to work:** Don't have any real work yet... starting with exercises on (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
