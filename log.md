# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 20, 2021
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started with the Basic HTML lessons to get a starting point for code. Finished the first lesson to put my brain starting into learning mode.

**Thoughts:** Just started this whole process and am using FreeCodeCamp's early lessons to get a footing of what I should be doing. I'm pretty new, and don't really understand a whole lot of what is going on. Will try and keep this up every single day, even I feel completely confused and lost. Yay to trying something new!

**Link to work:** Don't have any real work yet... starting with exercises on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)


### Day 1: February 21, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started learning the basics of CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the lesson and added some of the code to my Week-1-HTML file.

**Thoughts**: I've always wondered how CSS works and am blown away by how simple it is on a basic level. I'm guessing I haven't gotten far enough into it to really start learning the nuances, but it's exciting to learn things like margins and padding. Then also understanding the hierarchy of classes, IDs, and types. Just barely scratching the surface really. Stoked to see where this goes.

### Day 2: February 22, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: More progress on CSS and how to combine colors as well as using opacity to create new shapes. Just touched on animation as well. So cool!! Finished up the Applied Visual Design section on FCC.

**Thoughts**: CSS is continuing to impress me with how powerful it is, as well as how many uses there are for it. I used to think it just helped make text look a certain way, but now understand that it can be used for so many other things. From creating shapes to animation to create full scenes almost all online. Very cool! Lots more to still go, but very impressed all the way around.

### Day 3: February 23, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Working through the rules of HTML Accessibility and making sure the design of different elements can be read by Screen Readers & the colorblind. Didnâ€™t realize how important this was! Gotta fill out those Alt tags every time!!

**Thoughts**: While I've worked on developing websites for different events and ideas before, I never really took the time to notice how important it is to make sure the code is properly formatted for other reading devices. I've always just used WYSIWYG elements and when it looked write I called it done. Now I'm realizing there is so much more to all of the devices that crawl the web. I really need to focus more on filling out all of the elements so it's as readable as possible for a wide range of uses.

### Day 4: February 24, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished two FCC lessons! Learned how to use CSS format text to be responsive to screen size & width, then using flexbox to align elements in rows & columns corresponding to each other. Love how easily it builds balance! I can see this as being super powerful moving forward!

**Thoughts**: I've known that you can create small sections of content using the div fuction, but didn't realize you could then take those elements and super easily build rows or columns out of them! Super useful! I can see this being used a lot for building out formatting within apps and making sure certain types of text or buttons will end up being able to adjust to different screen sizes and DPI's. Need to dive into all of it more, and looking forward to tackling some of the projects coming up. Kinda nervous, but stoked to be learning all of this!

### Day 5: February 25, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grids!!! Learned how to build proper grid columns and rows, set up grid templates, and make grids in grids. This whole concept has been a bit harder to wrap my head around (probably should use minmax ;) ) but making progress. Slow but steady! Started on the projects at the end of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

**Thoughts**: Grids kick it all up a notch. Now there's a way to build out elements that will be responsice not only to screen size, but to each other in really controlled ways. I'm still fairly unclear on the way that the grid is counted vertically and horizontally, but at least understand how it can be build using the grid-template-areas property. Lots to still learn. Crashed my longboard today so typing is hard. Such is life... :S

### Day 6: February 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked the whole hour on FCC Projects starting with a Tribute page and then a Survey. Finally getting a solid grasp on input forms and the basic hierarchy of HTML. Projects sure do make you learn quick! Got the first two projects done, 3 more to go.

**Thoughts** While the lessons are super helpful and have a lot of coding involved, they really don't quite teach you as well as jumping into a project and trying to get the code working by yourself. There's different reasons to spend time on both side of this challenge; learning the basic fundimentals and then putting them into action. I think I've starting to just get the bare beginning of coding worked out, and am excited about continuing down this path. It's a frustrating world in a lot of ways, but I'm stoked to be getting further into it. :)

### Day 7: February 27, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Another FCC project in the can! This time working on a Landing Page. Got it completed in about an hour and a half. It was a struggle, but got it done!

**Thoughts**: Struggling a bit with remembering all of the options for different ways to format content on a page. Kinda feeling like I constantly have to Google everything I try to do. This is normal? Hoping that I can start remembering keywords again, either that or I need to go back through the HTML & CSS lessons again to remember how to do everything. That's a bit discouraging, but probabaly worth the time. Idk...

### Day 8: February 28, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating a Technical Guide webpage for the FCC project today. Trying to use CSS-organized lists to make sure everything is clean & orderly. Also linking inside pages. That hour went fast! Looking forward to wrapping up the project tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I had to go back so some of the original FreeCodeCamp tutorials to understand what I was missing from earlier. That REALLY helped! I think it might be a good idea to plan that I'll need to go through all of these tutorials more than once to make sure all of the concepts actually get cemented into my head. I was really really lost, but after getting the refresher I totally understand what each of the commands are for SO MUCH BETTER! Will keep this in mind when I'm confused about different things in the future. Lots still ahead! 

**Link(s) to work**: Nothing completed today, will post final link tomorrow. 


### Day 9: March 1, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Technical Guide FCC project today. Also spent a good amount of time going back through CSS principles to refresh everything I missed the first go-around. Was super helpful! Might have to do that more moving forward.

**Thoughts**: Going back through the lessons is tedius, but so incredibly helpful. I started by doing that for a little bit, then coded for about a half-hour, then came back to it. It's kinda great to do a mix of both so I can see how to use the principles while as the same exact time learning them. I think I might have to try that move moving forward, learning something then immmediately putting it to use somehow. Love it!

### Day 10: March 2, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the FCC challenges to take a deeper dive into CSS Grids on Scrimba . Really loved being able to play around with the code while learning. Can tell Grids are gonna be super useful moving forward.

**Thoughts**: Two steps forward, then one step back. I definitely needed to take that step back today, and get my mind wrapped around CSS Grids better. I can tell they are going to be super important moving forward in learning how to build apps that works on different devices and form-factors. Also really love how Scrimba works! Might think about gettting a subscription to them, as they're explainations of everything are super useful and easy to understand. Glad to be getting the basics better. Super positive day today! :)

### Day 11: March 3, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Working on more Grid techniques learning how to make the grids auto organize each other based on the browser window size. LOVE grid-auto-flow: dense !! Now I know how to get blog posts to look good no matter the length. WIN!

**Thoughts**: Today was a bit realization day that this code can be so much simplier than it seems. Also that I learn WAYYYYY better having someone explain concepts to me vs trying to read through instructions and get an idea that way. Might bite the bullet and start working through the Scrimba Front End Developer career path... seems like it may help give me enough basic knowledge to finally code my own projects.

### Day 12: March 4, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the basics of CSS today, and looking forward to heading into Javascript tomorrow. Finally get the whole Flexbox vs Grid concept and the different ways to simplify organizing blocks of content. Also justify vs align. So powerful. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts**: Finished up the Scrimba Grids free tutorial and then immediately subscribed to the rest of their courses. I'm not giving up on FCC, but I'm taking a break from it definitely to use Scrimba to gain a basic level understanding of all these concepts. There's a lot more to still learn, but I feel like it's going to be a bit faster to work through the concepts while learning vs trying to cram a lot of ideas then use them at the end. Yes, learning how to code shouldn't be comfortable, but at least I'm getting the concepts wayyyyy better. That's a Win!!

### Day 13: March 5, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Went back to the very basics of HTML on Scrimba and started working through the Frontend Developer career path. Also started in the basics of Javascript, and pretty happy with how similar it is to the bit of C++ I've already learned. Variables, Strings, Arrays, Operators... it feels very famliar to Unreal. Events are new tho. Just scratched the surface. 

**Thoughts**: I feel like I have a really good grasp on HTML at this point, and am excited to start putting more proper 'coding' into the pages. Yes, all of this is techincally coding, but the Javascript feels more like proper coding then simple html or CSS. I'm guessing that's what it all feels like once it starts making sense? Excited about where this is going. :) :)

### Day 14: March 6, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: After a taste of Javascript, I was struggling with FCC's way of explaining concepts. Took a step back, subscribed to Scrimba's FED Career path. Awesome refresh of HTML & CSS. Also learned how to link external CSS files. Moving quickly to catch up.

**Thoughts**: Teaching styles really matter. I liked how quickly FCC moved through concepts, but found myself really struggling with some of them because of the way the instructions were worded. Decieded to bite the bullet on Scrimba and am now working through their Front End Developer Career Path. It's great! Only sad part is having to start back over a bit with HTML & CSS. But glad to really get clarification on a lot of the concepts, and I think it's really going to make a difference as I keep moving forward.

### Day 15: March 7, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Lots of great refresher content with CSS. Learned background images and how to set relative file paths. Also how important setting a width then left/right margins to auto when trying to center content or divs. SO HAPPY to finally learn why I could never get it to work 

**Thoughts**: Really happy to have a better explaination of CSS with Scrimba. Really was having a hard time understanding what I was doing in FCC especially with centering content. Overall, really happy with how things are moving forward. Stoked to start the projects tomorrow and test how much I actually know. :D

### Day 16: March 8, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Scrimba Module 1: HTML & CSS challenges 1-8. Was able to do 95% of it from memory which is a win! Had to look up max-width tho haha.

**Thoughts**: CSS and HTML are really starting to set in! There is a lot more to learn, but I'm stoked to know that at least the concepts are in my brain, and now I can really start working through them even more. Stoked to also not have had to look up too much stuff via Google. I feel like I've actually learned!! Yay!

### Day 17: March 9, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the HTML & CSS challenges, so back into Javascript! Started logging out to the console and learning the syntax for variables. Changed a few button background color styles and text content. Just the beginning, but very promising!! More to come

**Thoughts**: Glad to be finally properly in Javascript and working through the concepts on Scrimba. It's soooo much easier to learn working through their challenges rather than FCC. Can't wait to jump fully into variables tomorrow.

### Day 18: March 10, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Diving deeper into javascript by learning conditional operators and methods/functions. Built a simple password authenticator using an if/else statement and connected it up to buttons to test input. Didnâ€™t realize it was this simple behind logins! Awesome!! 

**Thoughts**: Learning Javascript is going to be super useful also when writing C++ code in Unreal. Sooo many of the prinicples are shared, so getting practice in either will help the other to get stronger. I'm sure there will be small ways that I get confused when they do finally differ, but super excited about being able to learn both better when learning Javascript. Also kinda mindblown by how easy it is to put together a password authenticator. Can't wait to learn more about datatbases and being able to store passwords / forms. :)

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
