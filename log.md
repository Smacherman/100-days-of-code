# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 20, 2021
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started with the Basic HTML lessons to get a starting point for code. Finished the first lesson to put my brain starting into learning mode.

**Thoughts:** Just started this whole process and am using FreeCodeCamp's early lessons to get a footing of what I should be doing. I'm pretty new, and don't really understand a whole lot of what is going on. Will try and keep this up every single day, even I feel completely confused and lost. Yay to trying something new!

**Link to work:** Don't have any real work yet... starting with exercises on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)


### Day 1: February 21, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started learning the basics of CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the lesson and added some of the code to my Week-1-HTML file.

**Thoughts**: I've always wondered how CSS works and am blown away by how simple it is on a basic level. I'm guessing I haven't gotten far enough into it to really start learning the nuances, but it's exciting to learn things like margins and padding. Then also understanding the hierarchy of classes, IDs, and types. Just barely scratching the surface really. Stoked to see where this goes.

### Day 2: February 22, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: More progress on CSS and how to combine colors as well as using opacity to create new shapes. Just touched on animation as well. So cool!! Finished up the Applied Visual Design section on FCC.

**Thoughts**: CSS is continuing to impress me with how powerful it is, as well as how many uses there are for it. I used to think it just helped make text look a certain way, but now understand that it can be used for so many other things. From creating shapes to animation to create full scenes almost all online. Very cool! Lots more to still go, but very impressed all the way around.

### Day 3: February 23, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Working through the rules of HTML Accessibility and making sure the design of different elements can be read by Screen Readers & the colorblind. Didnâ€™t realize how important this was! Gotta fill out those Alt tags every time!!

**Thoughts**: While I've worked on developing websites for different events and ideas before, I never really took the time to notice how important it is to make sure the code is properly formatted for other reading devices. I've always just used WYSIWYG elements and when it looked write I called it done. Now I'm realizing there is so much more to all of the devices that crawl the web. I really need to focus more on filling out all of the elements so it's as readable as possible for a wide range of uses.

### Day 4: February 24, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished two FCC lessons! Learned how to use CSS format text to be responsive to screen size & width, then using flexbox to align elements in rows & columns corresponding to each other. Love how easily it builds balance! I can see this as being super powerful moving forward!

**Thoughts**: I've known that you can create small sections of content using the div fuction, but didn't realize you could then take those elements and super easily build rows or columns out of them! Super useful! I can see this being used a lot for building out formatting within apps and making sure certain types of text or buttons will end up being able to adjust to different screen sizes and DPI's. Need to dive into all of it more, and looking forward to tackling some of the projects coming up. Kinda nervous, but stoked to be learning all of this!

### Day 5: February 25, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grids!!! Learned how to build proper grid columns and rows, set up grid templates, and make grids in grids. This whole concept has been a bit harder to wrap my head around (probably should use minmax ;) ) but making progress. Slow but steady! Started on the projects at the end of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

**Thoughts**: Grids kick it all up a notch. Now there's a way to build out elements that will be responsice not only to screen size, but to each other in really controlled ways. I'm still fairly unclear on the way that the grid is counted vertically and horizontally, but at least understand how it can be build using the grid-template-areas property. Lots to still learn. Crashed my longboard today so typing is hard. Such is life... :S

### Day 6: February 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked the whole hour on FCC Projects starting with a Tribute page and then a Survey. Finally getting a solid grasp on input forms and the basic hierarchy of HTML. Projects sure do make you learn quick! Got the first two projects done, 3 more to go.

**Thoughts** While the lessons are super helpful and have a lot of coding involved, they really don't quite teach you as well as jumping into a project and trying to get the code working by yourself. There's different reasons to spend time on both side of this challenge; learning the basic fundimentals and then putting them into action. I think I've starting to just get the bare beginning of coding worked out, and am excited about continuing down this path. It's a frustrating world in a lot of ways, but I'm stoked to be getting further into it. :)

### Day 7: February 27, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Another FCC project in the can! This time working on a Landing Page. Got it completed in about an hour and a half. It was a struggle, but got it done!

**Thoughts**: Struggling a bit with remembering all of the options for different ways to format content on a page. Kinda feeling like I constantly have to Google everything I try to do. This is normal? Hoping that I can start remembering keywords again, either that or I need to go back through the HTML & CSS lessons again to remember how to do everything. That's a bit discouraging, but probabaly worth the time. Idk...

### Day 8: February 28, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating a Technical Guide webpage for the FCC project today. Trying to use CSS-organized lists to make sure everything is clean & orderly. Also linking inside pages. That hour went fast! Looking forward to wrapping up the project tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I had to go back so some of the original FreeCodeCamp tutorials to understand what I was missing from earlier. That REALLY helped! I think it might be a good idea to plan that I'll need to go through all of these tutorials more than once to make sure all of the concepts actually get cemented into my head. I was really really lost, but after getting the refresher I totally understand what each of the commands are for SO MUCH BETTER! Will keep this in mind when I'm confused about different things in the future. Lots still ahead! 

**Link(s) to work**: Nothing completed today, will post final link tomorrow. 


### Day 9: March 1, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Technical Guide FCC project today. Also spent a good amount of time going back through CSS principles to refresh everything I missed the first go-around. Was super helpful! Might have to do that more moving forward.

**Thoughts**: Going back through the lessons is tedius, but so incredibly helpful. I started by doing that for a little bit, then coded for about a half-hour, then came back to it. It's kinda great to do a mix of both so I can see how to use the principles while as the same exact time learning them. I think I might have to try that move moving forward, learning something then immmediately putting it to use somehow. Love it!

### Day 10: March 2, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the FCC challenges to take a deeper dive into CSS Grids on Scrimba . Really loved being able to play around with the code while learning. Can tell Grids are gonna be super useful moving forward.

**Thoughts**: Two steps forward, then one step back. I definitely needed to take that step back today, and get my mind wrapped around CSS Grids better. I can tell they are going to be super important moving forward in learning how to build apps that works on different devices and form-factors. Also really love how Scrimba works! Might think about gettting a subscription to them, as they're explainations of everything are super useful and easy to understand. Glad to be getting the basics better. Super positive day today! :)

### Day 11: March 3, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Working on more Grid techniques learning how to make the grids auto organize each other based on the browser window size. LOVE grid-auto-flow: dense !! Now I know how to get blog posts to look good no matter the length. WIN!

**Thoughts**: Today was a bit realization day that this code can be so much simplier than it seems. Also that I learn WAYYYYY better having someone explain concepts to me vs trying to read through instructions and get an idea that way. Might bite the bullet and start working through the Scrimba Front End Developer career path... seems like it may help give me enough basic knowledge to finally code my own projects.

### Day 12: March 4, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the basics of CSS today, and looking forward to heading into Javascript tomorrow. Finally get the whole Flexbox vs Grid concept and the different ways to simplify organizing blocks of content. Also justify vs align. So powerful. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts**: Finished up the Scrimba Grids free tutorial and then immediately subscribed to the rest of their courses. I'm not giving up on FCC, but I'm taking a break from it definitely to use Scrimba to gain a basic level understanding of all these concepts. There's a lot more to still learn, but I feel like it's going to be a bit faster to work through the concepts while learning vs trying to cram a lot of ideas then use them at the end. Yes, learning how to code shouldn't be comfortable, but at least I'm getting the concepts wayyyyy better. That's a Win!!

### Day 13: March 5, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Went back to the very basics of HTML on Scrimba and started working through the Frontend Developer career path. Also started in the basics of Javascript, and pretty happy with how similar it is to the bit of C++ I've already learned. Variables, Strings, Arrays, Operators... it feels very famliar to Unreal. Events are new tho. Just scratched the surface. 

**Thoughts**: I feel like I have a really good grasp on HTML at this point, and am excited to start putting more proper 'coding' into the pages. Yes, all of this is techincally coding, but the Javascript feels more like proper coding then simple html or CSS. I'm guessing that's what it all feels like once it starts making sense? Excited about where this is going. :) :)

### Day 14: March 6, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: After a taste of Javascript, I was struggling with FCC's way of explaining concepts. Took a step back, subscribed to Scrimba's FED Career path. Awesome refresh of HTML & CSS. Also learned how to link external CSS files. Moving quickly to catch up.

**Thoughts**: Teaching styles really matter. I liked how quickly FCC moved through concepts, but found myself really struggling with some of them because of the way the instructions were worded. Decieded to bite the bullet on Scrimba and am now working through their Front End Developer Career Path. It's great! Only sad part is having to start back over a bit with HTML & CSS. But glad to really get clarification on a lot of the concepts, and I think it's really going to make a difference as I keep moving forward.

### Day 15: March 7, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Lots of great refresher content with CSS. Learned background images and how to set relative file paths. Also how important setting a width then left/right margins to auto when trying to center content or divs. SO HAPPY to finally learn why I could never get it to work 

**Thoughts**: Really happy to have a better explaination of CSS with Scrimba. Really was having a hard time understanding what I was doing in FCC especially with centering content. Overall, really happy with how things are moving forward. Stoked to start the projects tomorrow and test how much I actually know. :D

### Day 16: March 8, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Scrimba Module 1: HTML & CSS challenges 1-8. Was able to do 95% of it from memory which is a win! Had to look up max-width tho haha.

**Thoughts**: CSS and HTML are really starting to set in! There is a lot more to learn, but I'm stoked to know that at least the concepts are in my brain, and now I can really start working through them even more. Stoked to also not have had to look up too much stuff via Google. I feel like I've actually learned!! Yay!

### Day 17: March 9, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the HTML & CSS challenges, so back into Javascript! Started logging out to the console and learning the syntax for variables. Changed a few button background color styles and text content. Just the beginning, but very promising!! More to come

**Thoughts**: Glad to be finally properly in Javascript and working through the concepts on Scrimba. It's soooo much easier to learn working through their challenges rather than FCC. Can't wait to jump fully into variables tomorrow.

### Day 18: March 10, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Diving deeper into javascript by learning conditional operators and methods/functions. Built a simple password authenticator using an if/else statement and connected it up to buttons to test input. Didnâ€™t realize it was this simple behind logins! Awesome!! 

**Thoughts**: Learning Javascript is going to be super useful also when writing C++ code in Unreal. Sooo many of the prinicples are shared, so getting practice in either will help the other to get stronger. I'm sure there will be small ways that I get confused when they do finally differ, but super excited about being able to learn both better when learning Javascript. Also kinda mindblown by how easy it is to put together a password authenticator. Can't wait to learn more about datatbases and being able to store passwords / forms. :)

### Day 19: March 11, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: All about the Loops today! Learned basic Loops as well as using Loops with arrays, nesting If statements in a Loop, and also a tiny bit of methods with classList.add. Finally seeing the light a bit more on how JavaScript can apply CSS.ðŸ’¡

**Thoughts**: Sooo now I'm finally starting to see how Javascript can affect the different ways that CSS is applied within HTML <divs> and other objects. This is just the beginning, but stoked about the progress! Also happy to learn a bit more of the methods that can be applied by addind/editing classes with classList.add to change parts of HTML to have CSS formatting on them. This is great!

### Day 20: March 12, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more Loops today, including putting Loops inside loops! Was able to build a Pac-Man type map using nothing but If statements and loops. So awesome! Didn't realize there was so much you could do with these.

**Thoughts**: So I'm learning a bit more about how I can use different functions and methods inside one another to produce not only clean code but more useful objects that can do some pretty cool things! It's still a bit hard to wrap my head around, but loving the stretching it's making my brain go through when thinking of how things can affect one another from inside something else.

### Day 21: March 13, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started in on Functions today and passing variables into them at runtime. Just got into the basics and excited to get into it more. Used it to build a simple random quote generator

**Thoughts**: Yess!! Functions are the bones of programming it seems. And being able to pass variables into the fuctions at runtime is a major key to making those bones actually do useful things. Lots to still learn here. More crazy brain wrapping. Love the exercise, and starting to see how I need to look at the world in a new way.

### Day 22: March 14, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some easy ways to modify arrays using push/pop and shift/unshift. Iâ€™ve seen these words all over code before, sooooo happy to finally understand what they mean!! Got a quick intro to the DOM as well. Will continue that more tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: It's always such a fun thing when I'm able to finally understand something I've been seeing all over code before, but never actually understanding it. Seriously it's like a whole viel is lifted off my eyes. PUSH AND POP!!! I remember seeing those in C++ and being like WTF??? It's just adding and removing sections of arrays! Super easy!! Can't wait to use them more in later applications! Also the DOM seems a bit vague (Document Object Model) so looking forward to getting more info to understand it tomorrow.

### Day 23: March 15, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to getElementById and grabbing multiple elements by using getElementsByClass and getElementsByTag. Going to practice these much more. Also started learning how to use VSCode with GitHub, and finally pushing my daily log up to GH using VSCode.

**Thoughts**:  Didn't really get a ton of learning done on Scrimba bc I took a bit of time to work out how to get GitHub working with VS Code. One of my friends recommended that I start using VS Code much more, because that's what I'll end up using in the real world anyways. Makes total sense to me. I was able to get some learning done starting to understand the getElementById function as well as getElementsByClass and getElementsByTag fuctions as well. Just barely touched  on querySelector and querySelectorAll, though don't really understand them a whole lot. I don't think this sections instructor is quite as good as the others at explaining some of these concepts, but will try to get through it nonetheless.

### Day 24: March 16, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Another big day in Javascript. Stoked to learn how to use querySelector/querySelectorAll to grab the classes and idâ€™s & use .textContent / .style to modify the HTML & CSS. Boom!! Powerful tools there! Defo know I can use those in projects in the future. 

**Thoughts**:  Some major progress today in putting together a few seperate ideas into some powerful methods. Using the .textContent and .style methods, I can finally use Javascript to modify my HTML and CSS code on the fly. Not sure how to get it to stick quite yet, but that's big progress. Also learned to use querySelector and querySelectorAll to grab different classes and ids of elements that I can then modify again using .textContent and .style, or even .value! Love it! Also used classList and className to change classes of objects on the fly! Can't forget about that!

### Day 25: March 17, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Getting deep in the interactivity! Learned createElement then how to append/prepend. Mix a bit of innerHTML in there (powerful!) then .addEventListener() to start creating triggers that run functions! This is dope! Changed some backgrounds on dblclick. FUN!!

**Thoughts**:  More things are startingt to click into place. It's still fuzzy here and there, but in general I'm starting to get a better handle on how to get elements to become interactive and start working with each other. There's still a LONG way to go before I feel like any of this informaiton is actually properly in my brain, but definitely am stoked about the level of progression so far. It's not just all greek anymore!

### Day 26: March 18, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the Javascript train Steam locomotive to do a brief 
@Scrimba course on Markdown rec'd by @Whyisbecase. This is used so much on Github, probabaly should learn it. Love how simple it is, but also powerful 4 building quick md pages. Will use this a lot!

**Thoughts**:  Kinda getting the picture that it's important to know a wide range of languages and types of code, rather than just focusing 100% on a single type. These really do build on each other, while also keeping themselves seperate. I'm guessing that when one gets too close to another, then end up merging or one of the two gets deleted. Even in code it's the survival of the fittest. :grimacing:

### Day 27: March 19, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Putting a lot of things together today. Working through creating a personal Emojis list app that adds and removes my personal Emojis. Using all that good Javascript knowledge. 

**Thoughts**:  Now putting together all of the knowledge while working through building a small app that lists our my personal emojis. I'm doing this challenge with Scrimba, and find that I can figure out about 80% of the nessesary progress on each step of the challenge. I haven't quite figured out how to get it all worked out yet, but feel fairly confident for not know really any of this about 26 days ago. Lots of awesome progress for sure! Need to work on my Googling skills... I can find answers easily enough, but don't have a lot of great luck getting them to work everytime.

### Day 28: March 20, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Personal Emoji project!!! Whooho!! (https://github.com/Smacherman/myPersonalEmojis) To celebrate I started a new project creating a personal online diary/thought-keeper. This one will also use lots of HTML/CSS/Javascript. 

**Thoughts**:  I'm learning more and more that coding and creating projects are really just a very small step by step process. You start with some very basic elements, and then build on them bit by bit. So much of my code from this Personal Emoji's project was all based off of the original push method I built to add Emoji's to the array. Then it was as simple as copy/pasting that code and modifying it for unshift, then copy/pasting a small bit of that code to create both the pop and shift methods. It really was pretty easy once I was able to get the orignal since fuction working. This definitely will be helpful moving forward!

### Day 29: March 21, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Wrapped up the Online Thought Keeper app! Got into a tough spot trying to keep each of the posts from all appearing at once. Finally realized I just needed a forLoop and set the elements to display: none! Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat Stoked it's done!

**Thoughts**:  Super excited about the progress I've been able to make within the last 29 days. It feels unreal that I've been able to go from not really knowing anything about HTML/CSS/Javacript and now being able to understand a bit of how these websites all fit together as well as how to create my own webApps! Still a HUGE gap of knowledge I need to close, and wouldn't be able to do half of this stuff without Scrimba's guidance. Will keep up the good work, but super stoked on how far I've been able to get so far.

### Day 30: March 22, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Had an awesome time jumping into javascript, but now taking a step back for the next couple of days to really cement CSS in my brain. Got to practice building a page from scratch and then styling links including the :hover, :visited, and :focus attributes.

**Thoughts**:  Loved the time jumping in to Javascript without really knowing anything, but also super thankful to now be going back into CSS to really master some of the concepts. I feel fairly confident about everything, and am having a great time putting to work the concepts that I've been covering. It feels pretty solid! Love filling in the gaps a bit now. Excited to keep pushing forward!!

### Day 31: March 23, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Another awesome further dive into #CSS with learning specificity (elements vs classes vs IDs) and compound selectors. Also how to make links look like buttons that are easier to see as well as being responsive. So cool!

**Thoughts**:  Love the idea of being able to make links into buttons super easily. Never really thought through how helpful that can be, especially with how much easier they are to see. Loved being able to understand how different CSS elements are ranked vs classes and IDs. And then putting those all togeher in compound selectors to make the code simpler to read. Awesome!

### Day 32: March 24, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Today was font day!! Learned how to integrate Google Fonts into my HTML and CSS, along with the importance of Font-Weight along with having multiple options in the Font-Families so things look as good as possible across a range of machines. Super important!  

**Thoughts**:  Super interesting to see how many fonts choices there are out there, and how they can really interact well with one another. I guess I didn't realize how easy it was to add different looks and styles of fonts to webpages, but now that I know it I'm seeing it everywhere. Cool!

### Day 33: March 25, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from lessons to do a challenge of formatting a page of CSS from scratch. Was great to focus on putting this new knowledge to work and seeing how well I can remember it all. A few hiccups, but stoked about the progress! More challenges tmrw!

**Thoughts**:  These CSS challenges are empowering, but also a reality check in some ways. It seems like it should be so easy to get all of these different elements to work together properly, and then is soooo freaking confusing when one simple thing (like centering text with a fixed width) will suddenly break all of your styling and hard work. Just goes to show me there is still a lot I have to learn before I'm ready to ask for a paycheck from it. Practice makes perfect though, so will just keep at it!

### Day 34: March 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More small CSS challenges today. Building a box grid, formatting a landing page, and creating an e-card invitation. Feeling more confident every day at CSS and being able to make HTML look a bit spicier. Fun! 

**Thoughts**:  More small steps today. Was struggling a bit trying to determine which parameter is supposed to get the styling, but kinda realizing it doesn't matter? All of them can end up getting you where you want to go, you just need to keep a focus as well on how it may end up impacting you later down the road. Super useful stuff!

**Today's Progress**: Switched over to a javascript challenge today. Made a Modal button that reveals the secret details of Homer Simpson's address. Took a minute, but got it working!

**Thoughts**: While CSS has been fun, I really think I like working in Javascript more. The ability to connect with any of the elements and change them as needed is awesome, and really allows for some fun interactivity. Looking forward to another challenge tomorrow!

**Today's Progress**: Another Javascript challenge - this time a search bar to find out what usernames exist! Learned how to use the .includes() function to check if one string is in another. Can see that being useful!

**Thoughts**: Learning a bit more about Javascript every day! Love these challenges. Haven't really been running into too many troubles with the JS except for missing commas and ; here and there. Often times when I can't solve parts of the challenges, it's usually bc I don't understand what the instructions are asking me to do. Will need to keep working on getting that confusion cleared up, because I'm sure my clients are going to have even less clear requests/instructions.

### Day 37: March 29, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a Carousel of images built from the ground up in HTML, CSS, and JS. Got the basic HTML & CSS in, now just working on getting the buttons functioning in JS. Will finish it tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: Man... I love Scrimba, but sometimes I really hate how they have the instructors do the step by step instructions of how to go through each challenge. Some are really great at explaining what it is you need to do, and others don't really word things in the a way that are clear on what needs to happen in which over. I guess I should expect that regular life will be the same, but MAN it's annoying. Will need to keep my patience when it happens in real life.

### Day 38: March 30, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Carousel! Got it up on GitHub. Definitely realized again I need to work on thinking through each small step instead of trying to tackle the whole problem at once. In time I'll learn. ðŸ˜…

**Thoughts**: Super tired today and unmotivated because of other work I'm having to do. But glad that I still showed up even if I not feeling the code or that I really have any business trying to learn this stuff. Somedays are better than others. Today was a struggle for sure. :S

### Day 39: March 31, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started a Dice game challenge with JS. Worked on getting the HTML all worked out while figuring what variables are needed. Feeling more confident in creating the small elements that will later come into play. Stoked on the progress!!

**Thoughts**: Super fucking smallll steps! That's all coding seems to be... super tiny small steps. My friend Greg M. mentioned using Git to take things slow and work through the ideas one by one. Then my other buddy John C. recommended creating a bunch of empty functions and classes to build out the scaffolding of an idea, then going through and filling in each element till you get the whole thing working. Love both ideas! Will definitely use them. (If you ever ready this... thanks guys!! <3 )

### Day 40: April 1, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Stoked to make it to day 40!! Finished up the Dice game by getting all of the Javascript in & working. Struggled a bit resetting the game but finally got all the variables back to their original state. Now on to a Snake clone!!

**Thoughts**: Really got a big confidence boost from this challange, as I had a bit of a grasp on what needed to be done as each step was laid out. Of course I still needed the help of a prompt, but at least I could take a guess and write out the code (mostly correct! :D ) that would be needed each time. Also been using the git commits as a great way to break down everything into small steps. Now using VS Code for just about everything, which is awesome!!

### Day 41: April 2, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Snake clone. Get some hung up on how to create the grids (display:flex AND THEN flex-wrap: wrap) as well as setInterval to control the timing. Lots of work to still do. More progress tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: Today was a challenging day. Felt like just about everything I should be getting was not working. Ended up having to throw in the towel without tons of progress, but at least I put in my hour. Gonna try to unwind from this crazy week... more tomorrow.

### Day 42: April 3, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Great success today! Got the Snake Game fully working and ready to play. Worked through some major challenges when adding/removing classes. Google saved the day. 

**Thoughts**: Had a major challengeing day yesterday, so today was extra happy when being able to finish up the basic functionality even with having issues. Wouldn't have been able to do it without Google and Scrimba. Sooo much I still don't know. Gotta keep learning!

### Day 43: April 4, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Jumping into CSS responsiveness today and will stay here for a bit moving forward. Get to know em vs rem and when is best to use not only a max-width but also a min-width. Gotta keep those paragraphs and images under control!

**Thoughts**: Glad to make the progression to another module in Scrimba, and out of the basic challenges for a bit. Love being able to work on the challenges, but also hungry to learn more and keep the progress going with learning new parts of HTML & CSS. Super excited to get to React, but not there quite yet.

### Day 44: April 5, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: More responsiveness lessons today. Got deep into media queries and a bit of flexbox while trying to have my page's content show up in the best layout for different devices. Kinda mind-blowing how basic the syntax is, yet powerful the end result can be. :star_struck:

**Thoughts**: I can tell already that I gotta get really good at Flexbox and media queries. They are going to be some of the most useful tools in the arsenol when putting together modern sites. So much of the internet is now accessed via mobile devices, I've got to make sure that I can make sure a website looks as good as possible both ways.

### Day 45: April 6, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Did a few more exercises getting a navbar to appear beside/below a site title depending on the frame width. Getting some good practice using that max-width 
@media query! :) More CSS practice is needed!

**Thoughts**: Today was a crazy day with my other work so it was a bit hard to focus on really putting things to work properly. But did put in the hour time at the very least, even withtout a ton to show for it. Got to keep this up, otherwise I'll never get to the end.

### Day 46: April 7, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a bit with Flexbox and trying to get different columns vs rows when screen sizes get smaller. Stoked how easy this is! Also learning it's better to style for mobile-first, then use @media queries to make it look good wider. Smart!

**Thoughts**: Slow progress today, but proud of getting through it. Not a whole lot to show besides the lesson that mobile first is the way to design, then figure out how to make your pages look good on wider screens. Will be super useful going forward!

### Day 47: April 8, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Wrapped up the Scrimba module on responsive design. Now on to some challenges starting tomorrow. Getting ready to break out all that Flexbox knowledge from the last couple days. Also gonna practice more pull requests with Greg McKelvey!

**Thoughts**: A tiny bit more progress today. I'm not really matching the exact timing of each of the lessons, but I feel like I am able to learn quite a bit even if it's taking a bit more time than I expected. All is good though! Everyday we're getting closer. :)

### Day 48: April 9, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Got through some great CSS challenges making pages responsive for both mobile and desktop screens. Lots of display: flex; and flex-flow: row wrap;! Working on learning how to adjust the order of things as well. Super powerful!

**Thoughts**: The display: flex property doesn't really do much without some sort of additional command like flex-direction, flex-wrap, or flex-flow. It's super helpful in getting information to format properly, but only with some major specifics included in the code. Gotta remember this for the future.

### Day 49: April 11, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: More Flex-Flow today! Not using this as much as I should be in challenges. Such a great shorthand to use in media queries. Finishing up the Flexbox challenges tomorrow and then back into some more advanced CSS. 

**Thoughts**: Still not having the Flexbox concepts really sink in like they should be. But at the same time, some of these challenges are not super well explained. Like I can't tell if it's me just not understanding the concepts at large, or not understanding what the challanges are asking me to do. One way or another, still need more practice. Was able to take Saturday off this week to celebrate my dad's 75th birthday. Love ya Dad!! :heart:

### Day 50: April 12, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Stoked to make it to day 50!! It's been an awesome journey every step of the way! Celebrated by finishing some challenges and learning how to adjust line-height and letter-spacing. Looking forward to the next 50 days and all that they'll bring!

**Thoughts**: It's been a bit tougher then I expected, and there have been some hiccups along the way, but I've made it half of my 50 days of code!! YAY! Of course after learning this I've just come to realize that there's so much more I need to learn before I could be of actual use. There are ways I can find work with the skills I have now, but it'll be so beneficial if I keep expanding my ideas while looking for new oppertunities! There's real promise for awesome work on the horizon! Looking forward to it!!! :smile:

### Day 51: April 13, 2021
<!-- // ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Background images today in CSS. And all of their fun styles and ways to have them tile and stretch. Looking at other web pages, I can tell these are definitely going to become staple style elements. Working on building a demo BBQ page!

**Thoughts**: Another awesome concept and styling element that is used all over the web: Background Images! And it's so easy to get them added to a page or div. I'm guessing it will be a bit harder to get them to do exactly what I want to them do when I use them, but for now it's great to see how quickly they can go onto a page and suddenly make it look super dope.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
